This example demonstrates a subtle issue in VBScript related to the `IsEmpty` function and how it interacts with empty strings.  The function `f` intends to handle cases where arguments `a` or `b` are empty by defaulting to 0.  However, an empty string ("") is not considered `IsEmpty`. Thus the addition will fail with a type mismatch error when passing an empty string to the function. This is different from passing an uninitialized variable, which would be properly recognized as `IsEmpty`.
